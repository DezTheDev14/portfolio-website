Upon publishing my web page to GitHub.io, I realized that it's overall formatting had become distorted from what I was seeing in my IDE.
I'm not quite sure how to address this issue. Should I create a "class" setting the border of the web page and apply it to the "body"?

            <p> If you're looking for a project contributor or to hire an ambitious, curious, and driven Software Developer with a fresh perspective, then please don't hesitate to reach out to me! I look forward to working with other talented, like-minded Software Developers to build exciting and meaningful software/digital content. </p>

            <p> Outside of the Software Development sphere, I have strong interests in the various mediums of visual entertainment & communication such as: 
              <ul>
                <li> Film/Television </li>
                <li> Video Games </li>
                <li> Web Comics </li>
                <li> User Interface Design </li>

            <h2> My Journey </h2>

            <img class="image-center" src="images/highway.jpg" width="300" height="350" alt="open road">

            <p> After graduating from college, I tried my hand at a myriad of different careers across several industries. From energy, to finance, to the legal field. I found myself dissatisfied with several of my previous career choices and was in search of something more meaningful in my life. </p>

            <p> Given the fact that technology and the digital space will be increasingly integral parts of society as we move forward into the future, I thought it prudent to think about careers in the same vein. I became enthralled by the prospects of Software Development and the things that I would be able to create. I liked what I was reading, but I didn't quite know where to start. And that's when I stumbled across <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank"> <strong> Thinkful. </strong> </a> </p>

            <p> With the guiding hand of Thinkful, I've undertaken the perpetual journey that is learning to become a capable Software Developer and I couldn't be more excited about what the future holds. </p>

            <p> A personal project that I'll be working on over the next several months is a web application to facilitate the definitive and accurate power-scaling of characters from the One Piece anime/manga (and this will naturally extend to other works of fiction as well) utilizing qualitative narrative elements. </p>

            <p> Stay tuned for future updates! </p>
